## Course description

The 8-week web development course is designed to take students through modern technology stacks for web development. Students will come away from the course with a solid understanding of web development concepts and implementation and be able to create their own products from scratch. As new technologies come out, this course sets them up for continued learning and expansion of skill sets.

The first half of the course will take students through their first programming language and web development framework, and the last half of the course will cover dynamic front end considerations and students will build their own web application. Throughout the course, students will create scripts and web applications from scratch to apply their learnings and build out their portfolios.

In addition, we include topics related to entrepreneurship and product development. Being able to lead the development of a fully fleshed out application or product from conception to market is an increasingly valuable skill in today's world, whether students intend to launch their own startups and projects, or are looking to work in tech or other industries.
