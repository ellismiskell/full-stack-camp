### Question

Here is a typical software engineering interview question:

"What happens when you type google.com into your browser's address box and press enter?"

### Answer

As you might imagine, It's complicated. There are a *lot* of things that happen.

A bird's-eye view gives insight into the "full stack".

!

### Learning objectives

- Understand and explain what happens when you type google.com into your browser's address box and press enter
- Gain an appreciation of complexity hidden beneath the hood of everyday actions
- Learn important terms and concepts in "full stack" web development, which we will come up again in more depth later

### The "g" key is pressed

What you see:

- Autocomplete

What you don't see:

- Lookups for suggestions

!

### The "enter" key bottoms out

What you see:

- Things start to happen. Your browser might blank out, or start refreshing
- Progress bars, spinners
- "X" instead of refresh symbol â†»

What you don't see:

- State of the browser changes. Goes into this in-between loading state.
- The `WM_KEYDOWN` or `KeyDown` event
- The keycode `13`, which stands for the "enter" key, is transmitted to the computer (USB, PS/2 interface, or a "virtualized" keyboard, like from a touchscreen)

### Browser parses the URL

- Browser looks for the `protocol` "http", the `hostname` "google.com" and the `resource` "/".
- Browser decides if this is a URL or a search term. Browsers will default to searching if what's entered in the address bar isn't a valid URL.
- Checks if website needs to be redirected via the HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) list.
- Converts non-ASCII Unicode characters in hostname. Only certain characters are valid for hostnames, `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, `-`, and `.`.

!

### Browser looks up the DNS

- First, it checks the `cache`.
- If it can't find it in the cache, it'll `gethostbyname`, which first checks the `hosts` file (OS dependent).
- If it can't find the host in the `hosts` file, it will look for it in the DNS server, which is determined by the network (router, modem, etc.)

!

### Browser makes a connection

- Now that it has the IP address, it will open a `socket`
- What's important here is the IP address and the `port`, for example a router is typically configured to `192.168.1.1:80`. The IP address is `192.168.1.1`, and `80` is the port number.
- Another example of an IP address is `127.0.0.1` which is typically your `localhost`.

!

### Request and response

- If the protocol is secure (HTTPS), it will do a TLS (Transport Layer Security) handshake
- For both HTTP and HTTPS, it will do an HTTP `GET` request
- For each `request`, there is a `response`
- A typical response is a `200 OK`, which means everything was good
- Other responses include `301 Moved Permanently`, which is a redirect, `404 Not Found`, and `500 Internal Server Error`.
- The first digit usually signifies what kind of code it is (e.g. `2xx`, `3xx`, `4xx`, or `5xx`).

!

### Browser parses resources

- The response comes along with `resources`, which include all the data that a browser needs to render a page: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.
- Browser has to parse each of these resources to construct a tree known as the `DOM` (document object model).
- The DOM represents each of the HTML `elements` on a page and their hierarchical relationships. Each element also comes with a set of `attributes`.
- An element is an individual component, whereas an attribute is a modifier specific to that individual component (e.g. `<p></p>` is an element and `<p class="title"></p>` is a `p` element with a class attribute set to `title`)

!

### Browser renders page

- It goes through each of the nodes in the DOM tree and calculates the sizes of them on the page
- These calculations are dynamically determined by a bunch of factors: CSS box model (margins, borders, padding), viewport, CSS position (float, absolute, relative), etc.
- Does actual graphic rendering of page (often involves GPU commands through Direct3D or OpenGL)

!

### Summary

- A ton of things happen when you type google.com into your browser's address box and press enter
- Many moving parts, interdependent pieces of a larger system
- Most of this is abstracted away in different layers, which allows you to think of only the problem at hand
